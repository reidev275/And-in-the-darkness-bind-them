# And in the darkness bind them: A functional workflow to rule them all

How much of the code you write goes towards solving the problem at hand?  Do your projects stay on the happy path, or do they quickly devolve into null checks, argument exceptions, and try catches?  In this talk we'll use one simple algebraic data type and a small handful of helper functions to build a functional workflow that reduces errors, increases modularity, and keeps you coding on the happy path.
